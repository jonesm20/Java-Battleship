The shell scripts in this directory were tested against SU's CS1 server.

While they can be run standalone for development purposes, they can be called
by a build automation tool, like Jenkins, and serve as source-controller build
scripts.

An AWS EC2 t2.micro server running AWS Linux and Jenkins used these scripts 
during this class project to achieve a source-controlled CI/CD pipeline.
